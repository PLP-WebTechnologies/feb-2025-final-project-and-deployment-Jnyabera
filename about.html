      <h2>About Pinglink</h2>
      <p>PINGLINK is a community-based organization that is formed by a number of youths hailing from kawangware who has successfully waded the challenges to join the promising future in the tech space. As part of giving back to the community that raised us, and to make available opportunities that us ourselves only wished of, we had decided to come together to train and provide skills probono to our community.</p>
